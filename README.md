# Distance-Measuring-Device-using-Ultrasonic-Sensor-and-Arduino
This project demonstrates a simple distance measuring device built with an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04), a 16x2 LCD display, and an Arduino. The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance to an object by sending out sound waves and calculating the time taken for the echo to return. The measured distance is then displayed in real-time on the lcd display
